# WORKSHOP IN LOCUS COMMUNITY

This project contains all the files that I have created during my learning phase in Workshop organized by Locus Community.
Here, I have included all the assignment of all the day of each workshop with comment that help you
to understand each line of code in a smooth manner.

For each Workshop I have created seperate folder inside where i have kept 
all the code for that workshop.

Moreover, I had also written the theory of the code with detailed explaination that might be very useful for you.

These files are for all those people who have come here to gain some knowledge over programming and these files are absolutely for you.
Just increase your knowledge and try helping to other people.

To write all the code I have used `Visual Studio Code` as my Editor and `Python 3.9.5` as interpreter.
